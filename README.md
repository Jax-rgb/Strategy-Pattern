# Strategy-Pattern

## Problem Scenario

In a **GameApp**, we have three types of characters, each with distinct **attack** and **defense** behaviors:

- **Knight**  
  - **Attacks** with a sword (`SwingSword`)  
  - **Defends** using three strategies: **Shield**, **Dodge**, and **Magic Barrier**

- **Wizard**  
  - **Attacks** by casting spells (`CastSpell`)  
  - **Defends** only with **Magic Barrier**

- **Archer**  
  - **Attacks** by shooting arrows (`ShootArrow`)  
  - **Defends** only with **Dodge**
